# Internal Strategy Deck – Oncology Portfolio Review (2023)

## Background
Over the last decade, multiple approved small molecules have been evaluated for adjunctive use in oncology indications. Several antihistamines and anti-inflammatory agents were deprioritized during early feasibility assessment due to lack of clear biomarker-driven patient stratification.

## Historical Findings
Between 2016 and 2021, exploratory trials assessing immune-modulatory effects of repurposed agents showed inconsistent outcomes. The absence of companion diagnostics and heterogeneous patient populations contributed to unclear efficacy signals.

## Recent Developments
Emerging literature from 2022 onwards highlights the role of immune checkpoint modulation and tumor microenvironment alteration by non-oncology molecules. Preliminary preclinical studies suggest that second-generation antihistamines may influence cytokine signaling pathways relevant to tumor progression.

## Strategic Implications
Re-evaluation of deprioritized molecules using modern biomarker stratification and combination therapy frameworks could unlock new clinical value. Focus areas include solid tumors with inflammatory components and oncology patients with comorbid allergic conditions.

## Recommendations
- Reassess select antihistamines for adjunct oncology indications  
- Align future trials with biomarker-led patient selection  
- Explore low-risk Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies

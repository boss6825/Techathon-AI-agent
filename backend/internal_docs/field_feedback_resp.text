# Field Feedback Summary – Respiratory Therapy Area (2022)

## Overview
Field interactions with pulmonologists across Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities indicate persistent unmet needs in asthma management, particularly among patients with overlapping allergic rhinitis.

## Key Observations
Physicians report that standard inhaled corticosteroid and bronchodilator regimens often fail to fully control symptoms in allergic subpopulations. As a result, adjunct therapies are frequently prescribed off-label to improve patient outcomes.

## Prescribing Behavior
Second-generation antihistamines are commonly added in patients with seasonal exacerbations. While not part of core asthma guidelines, these agents are perceived as safe and beneficial in real-world practice.

## Challenges
Lack of formal indication and limited clinical trial data restrict broader adoption. Physicians express interest in evidence-backed repositioned therapies that address both asthma and allergic components.

## Field Insight
There is openness among clinicians to adopt repurposed molecules if supported by clinical evidence and regulatory clarity.
